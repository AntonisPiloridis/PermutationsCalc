# PermutationsCalc
PermutationsCalc is a static github page that uses [pyscript](https://pyscript.net/) to display all possible permutations with repetition. This page was created to test the pyscript framework and to runtime a python library ([pcomp](https://github.com/AntonisPiloridis/pcomp)) on the web.
