# PermutationsCalc
PermutationsCalc is a static github page , which uses [pyscript](https://pyscript.net/) to display all possible permutations (with repetition). This page was created to test the new pyscript  project and to runtime a python library ([pcomp](https://github.com/AntonisPiloridis/pcomp)) on the web.
